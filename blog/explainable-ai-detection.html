            <h2>The Industry Challenge</h2>
            <p>Deep Learning models are now better than humans at many visual tasks, from diagnosing diseases to driving
                cars. However, they suffer from a critical flaw: <strong>lack of transparency.</strong></p>
            <p>If a model rejects a loan, denies an insurance claim, or misdiagnoses a patient, "the computer said so"
                is not a legally or ethically acceptable answer.</p>
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> How do we deploy high-accuracy Deep Learning models while ensuring they are
                transparent, fair, and trustworthy?</p>

            <h2>My Solution: Explainability by Design</h2>
            <p>In my research <em>"Detection of ... using explainable AI techniques"</em>, I focused on bridging the gap
                between <strong>Performance</strong> and <strong>Interpretability</strong>.</p>

            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>I implemented a detection pipeline that doesn't just output a class label (e.g., "Tumor Detected"), but
                also provides a <strong>visual evidence map</strong>.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Saliency Mapping:</strong> I used techniques like <strong>Grad-CAM</strong> and <strong>LRP
                        (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation)</strong> to highlight exactly which pixels contributed most
                    to the decision.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation:</strong> We verified these heatmaps against expert knowledge. For example,
                    ensuring the model was looking at the <em>tumor</em> and not a ruler or watermark in the background
                    (a common source of data leakage).</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Achieved 99.7% detection rate on the benchmark dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Demonstrated that the model learned valid physical features (shape,
                    intensity) rather than spurious correlations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Business Impact & ROI</h2>
            <p>For any company deploying AI, XAI is no longer optional—it's a requirement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Meets the "Right to Explanation" requirements of GDPR and
                    the EU AI Act.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging & QA:</strong> Allows engineers to quickly identify <em>why</em> a model failed
                    (e.g., "it confused snow for a cloud").</li>
                <li><strong>User Adoption:</strong> Doctors and professionals will only use AI tools they trust. XAI
                    provides that trust.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PyTorch:</strong> Deep Learning framework for model training.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> Image preprocessing and manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Captum:</strong> Library for model interpretability and understanding.</li>
            </ul>
